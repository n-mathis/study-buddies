# 🎉 What it does
Lets students create accounts on the app and login to view other student profiles. It's the studying version of Tinder. The user will view profiles that have similar traits, such as class or subject they are interested in studying for, and can decide if they want to match with them. If both users decide to match, they can then message and plan to meet up, whether in person or virtually, to study together (this part isn't functional).

# 🔧 How it is built
We used React Native and Firebase to create Study Buddies. We wanted to make an app that could, at the minimum, match users based on subject they want to study. After deciding what the MVP was, we prototyped the UX/UI using Figma and started learning React Native. We slowly incorporated Firebase into our project and got the Realtime Database and Authentication working for users.

# 🚀 How to run it
Follow the environment set up for the [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
## IOS

```ssh
git clone git@github.com:n-mathis/study-buddies.git
cd study-buddies
